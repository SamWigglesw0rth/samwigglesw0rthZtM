Hedgehogs are nocturnal creatures: Hedgehogs are primarily active during the night, making them nocturnal animals. They have a well-developed sense of hearing and smell, which helps them navigate and locate food in the dark.

They are excellent swimmers: Despite their spiky appearance, hedgehogs are surprisingly good swimmers. They can swim across small bodies of water, such as ponds or streams, using their powerful leg movements. However, they are not naturally aquatic and prefer to stay on land.

Hedgehogs have around 5,000 spines: Hedgehogs are covered in sharp spines, which are actually modified hairs. An average hedgehog has approximately 5,000 spines on its back, which act as a form of defense against predators. These spines can be raised and bristled when the hedgehog feels threatened.
